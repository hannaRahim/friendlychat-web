### Project Background

The **Friendlychat** project is a web-based chat application built using Angular. It allows users to communicate in real-time through a user-friendly interface. The application is designed with features such as message notifications, user authentication, and a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. Friendlychat aims to provide a simple yet powerful platform for individuals to engage in casual conversations online.

### Discussion

The **Friendlychat** project was developed with the goal of creating an intuitive and interactive messaging platform. Throughout the project, we focused on ensuring the application’s scalability, responsiveness, and real-time capabilities. One of the main challenges encountered was implementing real-time messaging functionality, which was achieved using Firebase for backend support. The project also required careful attention to UI/UX design to ensure ease of use across various devices.

The development process involved integrating Firebase for authentication and message storage, leveraging Angular’s component-based architecture to maintain clean and modular code, and utilizing Angular’s routing features to manage user navigation within the app. By the end of the project, we gained valuable experience working with Angular, Firebase, and real-time application development.
